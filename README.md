## Ecosystem Simulator
A simulated ecosystem I made for my OOP (Object Oriented Programming) course project.

Coded the entire project in java, using Java Swing library for graphics visualization.

#species
Carnivore: Eats herbivores and Cannibals (Red circles)
Cannibals: Eats anything but Plants (Blue circles)
Herbivores: Eats Plants (Dark green circles)
Plants: Grow spontaneously over time (light green dots)
